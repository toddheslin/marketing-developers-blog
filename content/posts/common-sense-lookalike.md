Lookalike modelling is when we try to label people who *we think* are similar to other people we believe are valuable.

We start by identifying who is valuable. We could do this based on _who they **are**_, e.g. female, 25-35, lives in an Australian metro area, or based on _what they **do**_, e.g. visited our website twice in the last week and added an item to the shopping cart. At this point we can separarte all customers into these two groups, those who meet the criteria ('Team A') and those who don't ('Team B').

Now we have our teams, we need to answer two questions: "what other charactistics or behaviours do people in *Team A* share?" and "what other chartactistics or behaviours do people in *Team B*......

Now we choose on one or more characteristics about these people that might also be correlated to

That's it.

At this point you can see the assumptions piling up, and this is why lookalike modelling gets such a bad name. It's not because the concept is flawed, but the assumptions are rarely understood. This post is going to break apart this simple concept and rebuild it from first principles.

## Loving and hating lookalike modelling
Proponents of lookalike modelling tend to be marketers with a paid media focus. Why? Their incentive is to spend media dollars more efficiently. Lookalike modelling to these people tends to mean offloading it to the *all-knowing* Facebook, Google, Amazon, and adtech industry. The lookalike modelling narative is dominated by the adtech players comparing their solution to other adtech companies.

The truth is that paid media lookalike modelling serves a very specific purpose. Even if you throw amazing AI at the problem, something you'll see in every adtech sales pitch, these solutions are only as good as how well you describe the audience you are modelling from.

Let's talk about hating.

I've been a long-time hater of lookalike audiences. My approach to understanding audiences is very programatic. After some deep conceration, I realise that I specifically hate handing over control to an adtech player who has an incentive to be *good enough* to keep the ad dollars flowing.

Truthfully, part of this is that marketers are offloading their responsibility to be better marketers by relying too heavily on lookalike audiences.
