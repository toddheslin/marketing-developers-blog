Marketing Developers are web developers who build things to solve marketing problems. We sit somewhere between the marketing and web development teams.

When writing this blog, I have three types of Marketing Developers in mind:

1. The <mark>freelancer</mark> working with multiple clients, usually (needy) smaller businesses
2. The <mark>technical digital marketer</mark> who is the the *go to* technical person in a digital marketing agency
3. The <mark>web developer</mark> building and maintaining the public-facing marketing sites for a marketing organisation

_To save writing the entire title over and over again, I'm going to settle on the acronym **Mkt Devs** to cover all of us._

We face a handful of constraints and challenges that our colleagues working in an engineering product team or web development agency might not need to deal with (or at least as often as we do).

Here are some that come to mind:

- Communicating with our non-technical clients and colleagues is hard emotional labour. Explaining the trade-offs of time, budget, reliability and maintainability is difficult.
- We need to integrate with legacy software, and it mostly sucks.
- Our analytics and marketing stack is highly configured, and configuration typically lacks consistency across clients, projects, and within our team (if we have one).
- We spend way too much time context-switching between different clients/projects/sites that we maintain but didn't build, or built a long time ago.

With these challenges in mind, the Marketing Developer Blog is a resource to find solutions to these common problems, keep you motivated to learn and grow, and above all ensure you never feel like you're solving these problems on your own.
